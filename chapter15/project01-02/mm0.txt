Metamath Zero is a theorem prover which is built to solve the problem of
bootstrapping trust into a system. Yet at the same time it is general purpose
-- it does not use a tailor-made program logic, it uses whatever axioms you
give it, so it can support all common formal systems (ZFC, HOL, DTT, PA, really
anything recursively enumerable). It is extremely fast, at least on
hand-written inputs like set.mm, and can handle computer-science-sized
problems.
